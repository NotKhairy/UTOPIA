## Intro

**Attack on Titan: Utopia** is a one-player, endless tower defense game inspired by the hit anime *Attack on Titan*. The story of the anime revolves around how titans, gigantic humanoid creatures, emerged one day and wiped out most of humanity. The few surviving humans fled and hid behind three great walls that provided safe haven from the titan threats: Wall Maria (outer wall), Wall Rose (middle wall), and Wall Sina (inner wall).

This game takes place in an imaginary scenario where the titans breached their way through Wall Maria and reached the northern border of Wall Rose at the **Utopia District**. The human forces stationed in Utopia engage the titans in battle for one last hope of preventing the titans from breaching Wall Rose. The humans fight by deploying different types of **Anti-Titan weapons** to stop the onslaught and keep Utopia’s (and Wall Rose’s) walls safe.

> **Tower Defense Games**: A type of game where the player controls a base, defending it from incoming enemies by deploying weapons/tools.
>
> **Endless Mode**: The game has no winning condition; the player continues playing to defeat as many enemies as possible.

## Space (Battle) Setting

The battlefield is divided into multiple **lanes**, each with:

1. **A part of the wall** to be defended, with HP that decreases when attacked. If destroyed, the lane becomes a **lost lane**.
2. **Weapons** deployed by the player.
3. **Titans** marching toward the wall. Each titan has HP and moves closer every turn.

Each lane has a **danger level** based on the number and types of titans inside it.

In the player’s base, the player can:
- View available weapons and purchase/deploy them.
- Monitor gathered resources, score, remaining wall HP, titan HP, and distances.
- See the order of approaching titans, which will spawn in upcoming turns.

The battle progresses through **three phases**:
1. **Early**
2. **Intense**
3. **Grumbling**
